we will have a class board
    will have methods like
    init 
        takes in a 2 dimensial array of strings
    check row(square)
        returns possiblities
    check column(square)
        returns possiblities
    check box(square)
        returns possiblities
    check all(squre)
        returns the results of all of the above three
    print board




squres will be subclasses of board
    attributes
    isConcrete()
        was the number give to us at the start?
    getSolved()
    setSolved()
    History - is a stack of what this number has been
    pushHistory()
    removeHistory()
    getHistory()

    position


program runs
    checks for possibilites in top left corner
        say it start on 5
    moves to next unSolvedSquare
        finds lowest possiblity
        if no more available possbilites
            mvoes back to last touched cell and moves the possiblity up
